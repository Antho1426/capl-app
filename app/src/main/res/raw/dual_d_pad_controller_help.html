<h1>DUAL D-PAD CONTROLLER Easter Egg</h1>
<h2>Configuration with the micro:bit of the Bit:buggy car-like robot</h2>
<p>Now that you have found the easter egg of the PaPL app, you can simply access to the total remote control mode of the robot by using this functionality of the app together with the proper setting of your micro:bit. To experience this, simply press more than 5 times on the "A button" of your micro:bit. Once the index is over 5, you can begin to freely use your robot with the game pad controller you just found!</p>

<h2>Control instructions</h2>
<p>Once you have correclty set up your robot, you can control it as follows: the up and down buttons of the left pad make the robot move forward and backward and the right and left buttons of the right pad make the robot turn in case it is already move either forward or backward. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>If you want to get back to the original control settings of the robot that works with the PaPL app standard features, simply press the A and B buttons together and this will reset the index to '0'.</p>
