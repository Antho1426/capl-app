<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use this application with your micro:bit you must do three things first:</p>
<h3>1. Pair your micro:bit with your phone or tablet</h3>
<p>You can pair your micro:bit with your phone quite easily using the Bluetooth screen within Android's Settings screen. The best way to learn how to pair with your micro:bit is to watch it being done by someone else. Here is a video showing the procedure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hLBfdAGkZI">Video: Pairing your phone with your micro:bit</a></p>
<p>The pairing procedure is described below as well if you prefer to read rather than watch.</p>
<p>Pairing makes your phone and micro:bit know and trust each other. Behind the scenes it equips them each with various encryption keys which they can use for security purposes.</p>
<p>You do not need to pair your micro:bit and phone every time your use them together. They will stay paired until either one of the two devices 'forgets' about the other. How  might this happen?</p>
<p>If you load a new hex file onto your micro:bit using a USB cable, your micro:bit will lose those encryption keys that were created when pairing. In other words it will 'forget' it was paired with your phone. So if you do use USB to flash a hex file then you will need to select your micro:bit in Android's Settings/Bluetooth screen and then select the Forget option to clear it from your phone. You'll then need to go through the pairing procedure again.</p>
<p>If you flash your hex file onto your micro:bit using Bluetooth, perhaps with the Samsung micro:bit application, you should not need to pair again. Flashing the micro:bit over Bluetooth does not erase those pairing keys.</p>
<h3>2. Load the suitable hex file onto your micro:bit</h3>
<p>You'll need the hex file that contains the micro:bit Bluetooth 'services' which are needed (see below) and to flash it to your micro:bit. As mentioned you can do this over USB (and will need to pair again) or over Bluetooth using an application like the Samsung micro:bit app (and will not need to pair again).</p>
<p>You can find the hex you have to load onto your micro:bit by following this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/_b166MjCrX0Hp">micro:bit hex file for the CaPL app</a></p>
<h3>3. Allow Bluetooth scanning to be performed</h3>
<p>On phones running the latest Android version, the first time you select the "FIND PAIRED BBC MICRO:BIT(s)" button you will get a dialogue pop up indicated that permission is required. You're being asked to let the application perform Bluetooth scanning which is how your micro:bit will be found (your micro:bit by the way is 'advertising' so it can be found). You should grant permission by selecting 'Allow' and then select the "FIND PAIRED BBC MICRO:BIT(s)" button again.</p>
<h2>Finding Your micro:bit</h2>
<p>To use any of the activities in this application, the first thing you must do is tell your phone to try to detect your micro:bit using Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Start by pressing the FIND button at the foot of the first screen and this will
    cause your phone to start scanning for micro:bit devices which are within Bluetooth range. </p>
<p class="important_text">IMPORTANT:</p>
<p>By default, only micro:bits you have paired your phone with will be listed for selection. If you haven't yet paired your device then follow the instructions in the 'Pairing' section below and then return to this application and select FIND again.</p>
<p>To allow the application to be used with micro:bit firmware builds which do not implement Bluetooth security, you can disable the filtering on non-paired devices from within the Settings screen which is accessible from the overflow menu.
</p>
<h2>PAIRING</h2>
<p>To pair your micro:bit with your phone go into the Android Settings screen and select Bluetooth.
    If your micro:bit is powered on and in range then you should see it listed in the bottom part of the Bluetooth Settings screen in a section probably entitled "Available Devices".</p>

<p>Switch your micro:bit into "PAIRING MODE" mode by holding down buttons A and B together and then pressing the reset button on the back of the micro:bit,
    continuing to hold buttons A and B for a second or two.</p>
<p>1. micro:bit shown as available but not paired in Android Settings, Bluetooth screen</p>
<p>2. Enter the 6 digit number which your micro:bit will display when put into BLUEZONE mode in this pop up dialogue</p>
<p>3. micro:bit now shown as paired. Now try to find it again from the "Device List" screen of this application.</p>
