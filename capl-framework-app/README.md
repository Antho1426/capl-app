# CaPL framework

## Version: 1.0.0


 * Author: Anthony Guinchard
 * Institution: EPFL
 * App based on the micro:bit Blue app from Martin Woolley


__Description:__ 


This capl-framework-app is a simplified version of the capl-app. By modifying some of its java classes, it allows to test the communication between the Android device and a robot with a Bluetooth module. This application contains only two main activities: `DeviceListActivity.java` (to connect) and `FreeGameActivity.java` (to make simple communication tests by sending commands to the robot).
