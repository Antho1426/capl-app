# papl-app
Mobile application for computer vision based tangible programming languages

The goal of this project is to further develop an existing prototype of the PaPL platform (C++, Python) developed during previous semesters at EPFL, so that it can be evaluated in classroom user tests. The work will mainly encompass the improvement of the computer vision algorithm and the development of a PaPL implementation for mobile devices (Android). This includes the creation of a mobile application as well as the fabrication of the tangible programming tiles. The project includes finally the development of the bridge for the communication with two new robots: one developed at the University of the Azores and another one at EPFL.
