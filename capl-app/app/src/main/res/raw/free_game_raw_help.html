    <h1>Free Game</h1>


    <h2>Principle of the activity</h2>



    <p>
        This "Free Game" serves as a base framework for the more elaborated activity called "Geography Game". It provides the features to load a physical tangible sequence of tiles captured by the camera of the Android device, to interpret these commands (in the case there are 'for loops' or even nested 'for loops') and to finally send them to the Cardbot. This activity allows to freely discover the working of the cardboard-based tangible programming language (CaPL).
    </p>



    <h2>Features</h2>


    <p>
        The steps to follow to program the Cardbot using the "Free Game" are numbered. This process is illustrated with following figure:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    First the users can either load their program by taking a picture of their tangible sequence of tiles using the "Camera" button, by loading a picture from the gallery of the Android device with the "Gallery" button or by loading one of the five built-in sequence examples. The latter possibility is realized by selecting one of the examples from the drop-down list and then by clicking on the button "Validate".

                    In addition, the users can also program the Cardbot digitally by clicking on the floating action button "Digital tiles" presenting the shape of a "middle tile support". This deploys the series of tiles in digital format from which the users can choose any element they want. This feature also allows the users to edit the sequence of tiles generated by the photos.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Then, the users click on "Identify tiles". In the case the sequence of programming tiles come from a photo, this step runs the computer vision algorithm allowing to recognize each of the symbols in the sequence.

                </li>

                <li>
                    Finally, the third and last step of the process is to send the commands to the robot. This is done by clicking on the button "Send commands". Using this button, each command is automatically sent one by one to the Cardbot until the end of the sequence. In addition to the "Send commands" button, the users can press the "Debug" button to execute one by one each of the commands at their own pace. The "STOP & RESET" button can be used to stop and reset the robot at any time.
                </li>

            </ol>

                    <p>
                        The "Free Game" provides a few kind of feedback regarding the execution of the commands by the robot:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If there is a mistake in the sequence, a toast error message is displayed.</li>
                        <li>The current executed command is highlighted with a red square in the sequence and copied underneath.</li>
                        <li>Information regarding the 'for loops' iterations are displayed. It prints the number of 'for loops' in the sequence, it indicates in which 'for loop' of the program the robot is currently situated and for each 'for loop' (nested or not) it indicates the iteration in which the robot is currently situated.</li>
                        <li>The LED matrix on top of the Cardbot adapts to the current command.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
