<h1>Activities</h1>
<p>This screen lists each available activities: the "Free Game", the "Geography Game", the "Device Information" and probably even something else... There are probably more than your phone can display on one screen so remember to scroll down to see the full list. You can find more information on each activity in its own "Info" page.</p>
<p>Note that if your micro:bit disconnects for some reason, you should go back to the "Device List" and select it again. This will reconnect the Android device and the micro:bit in the right state.</p>
